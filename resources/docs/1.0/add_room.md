##Step by Step guide

###How to use the canvas
- 'ALT' + 'Left Click': Move view of canvas
- 'Mouse wheel': Changes level of zoom
- 'Alter Slider': Changes size of shapes
- 'Reset View': Resets the view of the canvas 
- 'Colour Options' : Various Colour Pallets to allow a user to change the seat colours

### Step 1
- The reference length is used to ensure that seats are socially distanced. 
- Find the length of a real world wall/room/area
- Align the reference on the canvas with the length by moving it around the canvas
    - The `Scale Reference` can be used to change the length of the line
    - The `Angle Reference` can be used to rotate the line 
- Then input the real world length (in metres) within the `Real-Life Length (metres)` input field
- Select `Set Reference` button.

### Step 2
- `Seating Area`, where the seats will be. 
- Each area is an enclosed space so will only check the social distancing for the seats within the area.
- `Exclusion Area`, where seats aren't allowed to be. 
- `Set Seat Area`, once the seating areas are where you want them be they need to be 'set' so that its easier to add the seats.
- `Unset seat area`, if there's a problem with the seating areas you can unset them and change them. 
- `Delete Area`, can delete a seating area or exclusion area if its not needed.

### Step 3
- Add the number of the seats required using the `Add More Seats` .
- Can resize the seats with the `Size of Seats` slider.
- `Delete seat`, can delete un-needed seats.

### Step 4
- Enter the distance that you would like the seats to be apart (minimum)
- When attempting to save the system will alert you to any errors, this includes:
    - Seats overlapping
    - Seat not in a seating area
    - Seating area overlap with an Exclusion area
    - Where seats are too close together
    
- If the reference length is not set a warning will appear informing the user of this.
